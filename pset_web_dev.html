            After reading a sample of stories that document how users experienced ketamine, it became clear 
            that experiences wildly varied, both in terms of the sensory effects users had while on the drug and 
            whether users perceived their overall high as positive or negative. According to user stories on <a href="https://www.erowid.org/">Erowid</a> 
          , physiologically, users repeatedly noted that they felt increased heart rate, 
            bodily warmth and tingles, difficulty breathing and swallowing, difficulty interpreting language, and difficulty 
            feeling a steady progression of time. Users also repeatedly noted feeling a separation between their brains and 
            their bodies and many experienced hallucinations ranging from <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=60261">viewing their friends as being literally pixelated </a>
           to feelings of having their head disassociated from their 
            bodies.
        </p>
            
         
            <br><br>
<p>
            While some users noted that they pleasantly felt <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89549">“spacey”</a> or a 
            <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=43906">“dissociation from the senses of touch and sight”</a>, 
            others felt <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=72620">"woozy and dizzy."</a> One user who vomited after 
            using the drug called it <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=72620">“regretamine.”</a> Users were often
            unable to remember pieces of their hallucinations, and while some reported that the drug made them feel more 
            outgoing, others reported feeling <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=78627">noncommunicative.</a> 
         
        </p>
<br><br>
        <p>
          
            It's worth noting that none of the users exclusively used ketamine, so controlling for drug interactions 
            is difficult, especially since street ketamine widely varies in terms of purity. Another confounding factor 
            is that first-time users often had clear ideas about how the drug should feel — as one user put it 
            <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=89549">“I wanted to feel the odd shift in gravity most people felt”</a> — 
            meaning that expectation biases play a role here. 

            </p>
<br><br>
     <p>
      Regarding misconceptions, users clearly stated that ketamine should not be mixed with alcohol. 
        First-time users often anticipated a positive ketamine experience, then were disappointed when the drug 
        produced unpleasant hallucinations, dizziness, or nausea. Some users who had done so-called “harder drugs,” 
        like cocaine, underestimated the potency of the ketamine experience, though it is possible that these users took a 
        stronger dose of ketamine anticipating tolerance effects from other drugs to kick in. Many expressed surprise to find 
        that they had <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Ketamine_Health_Problems.shtml">health problems</a> after regularly using ketamine. 
            
            </p>
<br><br>
        
        <p>
            When viewing the drug in Visualizing Erowid, it’s clear that there are much less data on ketamine (286 reports) 
            than on other drugs like LSD and MDMA where reports top more than 1,100. The lack of data made analysis on
            metrics like sex and age of users tough, since many reports from all drugs do not include these distinctions. 
            Even with the dearth of data, Visualizing Erowid did reveal several patterns. Ketamine is most often compared to 
            or used alongside nitrous oxide. The word pairs section of Visualizing Erowid showed that data backs up anecdotal 
            observations about the user experience: Phrases like “sensory input,” “entire universe,” and “fourth dimension” 
            were mentioned repeatedly in user reports, though due to the lack of data, these phrases generally appeared in 
            less than 10 of total reports. 
            
         
            </p>
<br><br>
        <p>
        Data also confirmed that ketamine is often taken in tandem with other substances, cannabis, MDMA, and LSD being the 
        three most popular overall, though piracetam co-use has escalated considerably between 2013 and 2014. Again, 
        the sample sizes here are small. Visualizing Erowid shows that piracetam was the number one drug used with ketamine 
        in 2014, but that’s based on just four accounts. 
            
            </p>
<br><br>
        
        <p>
            Overall, Visualizing Erowid was able to give big picture overviews of ketamine use, but missed details 
            that are hard to root out through pure text analysis. Many users, for example, described feelings of spaciness,
            but because they used different synonyms, these descriptions were not comprehensively included in Visualizing 
            Erowid’s analysis.
